Our product is an open-source written in Java and relational databases with mobile-friendly. Everyone is welcome to download an instance or BootForum and/or custom it per your needs and configure the system in your language. This is an open-source, free version of BootForum. However, we also have custom versions for your needs at competitive prices.
